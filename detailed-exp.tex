    {Paris (Remote)\color{cvred}}
    {
      Prepared and implemented a multi-tenants {\bfseries Kubernetes} architecture (Azure) for all Sonepar entities to allow homogeneous deployment of company's assets.
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Automatized and deployed Kubernetes clusters (AKS) to host applications (Java micro-services and NodeJS).
        \item Massive and systematic use of the Operator Pattern \url{https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator}.
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Created a REST API (Go) to inventory and manage deployments of infrastructure components (using Custom Resources for storage).
          \item Deployments managed by ArgoCD and CI/CD.
          \item Created various operators based on this API.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Managed and resolved performance issues with related teams.
        \item Set up a log stack (Azure → Kafka → Fluentd → Splunk).
        \item Set up a highly available monitoring stack agnostic from the platform (Prometheus, Thanos, Alertmanager).
        \item Prepared multi-clouds deployment with GCP (network and agnosticity of Azure components)
      \end{itemize}

      \begin{itemize}
        \item Use of the Operator Pattern when relevant.

        \item Clusters managed as code with GitOps/FluxCD.
        \item AWS assets managed with Terraform.
      \end{itemize}
