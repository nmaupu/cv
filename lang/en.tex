\def\langDetailedExpSonepar{
  Prepared and implemented a multi-tenants {\bfseries Kubernetes} architecture (Azure) for all Sonepar entities to allow homogeneous deployment of company's assets.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Automatized and deployed Kubernetes clusters (AKS) to host applications (Java micro-services and NodeJS).
    \item Massive and systematic use of the \emph{Operator Pattern}. \newline \url{https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Created a REST API (Go) to inventory and manage deployments of infrastructure components (using Custom Resources for storage).
      \item Deployments managed by ArgoCD and CI/CD.
      \item Created various operators based on this API.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Managed and resolved performance issues with related teams.
    \item Set up a log stack (Azure → Kafka → Fluentd → Splunk).
    \item Set up a highly available monitoring stack agnostic from the platform (Prometheus, Thanos, Alertmanager).
    \item Prepared multi-clouds deployment with GCP (network and agnosticity of Azure components)
  \end{itemize}

\def\langDetailedExpEvoy{
  Implemented an "on-demand" {\bfseries Kubernetes} stack (AWS) to conduct a smooth migration of all SNCF components to AWS.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Use of the \emph{Operator Pattern} when relevant. \newline \url{https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator}
    \item Created a REST API (Go) to request the creation of new namespaces into clusters (DynamoDB backend).
    \item Created an operator (Go) listening this API and taking action on several events.
    \item Clusters managed as code with GitOps/FluxCD.
    \item AWS assets managed with Terraform.
