  Prepared and implemented a multi-tenants {\bfseries Kubernetes} architecture (Azure) for all Sonepar entities to allow homogeneous deployment of company's assets.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Automatized and deployed Kubernetes clusters (AKS) to host applications (Java micro-services and NodeJS).
    \item Massive and systematic use of the \emph{Operator Pattern}. \newline \url{https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Created a REST API (Go) to inventory and manage deployments of infrastructure components (using Custom Resources for storage).
      \item Deployments managed by ArgoCD and CI/CD.
      \item Created various operators based on this API.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Managed and resolved performance issues with related teams.
    \item Set up a log stack (Azure → Kafka → Fluentd → Splunk).
    \item Set up a highly available monitoring stack agnostic from the platform (Prometheus, Thanos, Alertmanager).
    \item Prepared multi-clouds deployment with GCP (network and agnosticity of Azure components)
  \end{itemize}
